TSP Line Art - or OCD etch a sketch drawings

When I was a kid I played a game with a pen and plain pice of paper with the only rules being: 
1. never lift the pen from the paper
1. don't cross any lines
1. end at the point you began (so line is continuous)

The resulting image would be a maze that you could attempt to traverse.

This image was created using the process and tools described [here](http://wiki.evilmadscience.com/Generating_TSP_art_from_a_stippled_image). My input image had  6079 points, and it took 15.39 seconds to run the 3 pass linkern TSP solver.
