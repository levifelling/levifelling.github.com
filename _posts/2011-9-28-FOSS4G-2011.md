#Levi's Summary
web design stuff is hot and will continue to get better. The cartographic tools for web mapping are really powerful. Stuff to watch: carto, mapnik, nodejs, tilemill, mapbox, cloudmade, html5

OpenLayers is no longer the only javascript map library out there. It is the most mature and feature rich one, but that comes with the downside of bloat, complexity, etc. There are other options that may be better suited for your project needs. 
- polymaps, modestmap, leaflet, wax

Postgis is king! This database is so awesome and so stable that there is (almost - think spatialite) no reason to look elsewhere. Postgis2 is coming soon with raster support - woot.


## stuff I am researching because I think it will be essential in the future
HTML5 + Designers
        Mapnik / OSM
Developmentseed:
        Mapbox/Tilemill
Vizzuality:
        CartoDB
        CartoSet
