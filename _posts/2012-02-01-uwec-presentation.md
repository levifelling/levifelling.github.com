title: "UWEC Presentation"
---

Tonight I gave a talk to the UWEC ACM club. ACM stands for something like "Association for Computing Machinery" and is made up of undergraduate computer science students. The talk was well attended (certainly for the free pizza and not for my presentation) 30 students, 1 prof (no girls, really not one).

This was basically a recruiting talk, so I discussed and demo'd projects from ADC. But I also wanted to share some wisdom that I feel the students are not getting on campus (or at least I didn't get when I was there 8 years ago). So the gist of my talk was how awesome github.com is as:

 1. a resource to view professional code and 
 1. a platform for them to demonstrate their skills.

As a student learning to program github is a tremendous resource. Having access to source code, commit logs, bug reports, etc for professional quality software is about as good a way to learn as there is. Here are a few of the repos that I threw out for reference (and name recognition):

* https://github.com/torvalds/linux
* https://github.com/apache
* https://github.com/facebook
* https://github.com/twitter
* https://github.com/google
