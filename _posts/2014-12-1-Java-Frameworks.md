Recently I've come across the following Java Web Frameworks:

- [dropwizard](http://dropwizard.io/)
- [jhipster](https://github.com/jhipster)
- [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

Time permitting I plan on building sample projects with each as a way to evaluate their viability for future development projects.
