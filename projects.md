##Sustainable living 

My family and I are committed to living simply and sustainably in our modest east hill home. Our garden provides much of our diet, and we supplement what we cannot grow, gather or hunt with organic locally grown food. 

##Hammond Organs

I’ve been collecting, playing, restoring vintage Hammonds for a number of years. In my collection right now are A105, C2, M3, Leslie 147, Leslie 225.

##Drums

I’m a drum nut. Been playing in bands since I was 12. I’m on a New Orleans kick currently. Check out some of the vids [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL405ACF0B120E648E&feature=plcp) for a taste.
