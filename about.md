  Hello - Iâ€™m Levi Felling, a software developer, musician, gardener, and dreamer currently living in midwestern America. This site is a test ground for new ideas and a place to share stuff that would otherwise be stuck in my head.

##Work

Since 2004 I have been employeed at [Applied Data Consultants](http://adc4gis.com). Officially my title is CTO, but really I'm a dev who dreams big.

##Music

I'm a drummer... The backstory of my musical experience is posted on my [family blog](http://aiken-felling.blogspot.com/2008/07/fathers-day-adventure.html)
